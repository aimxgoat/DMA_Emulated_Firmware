This is a public firmware, so don’t expect it to last long (EAC/BE/Rivals/COD will work fine for a couple of months, for sure)
Since the current market is flooded with scammers selling $150+ firmware that only bypass EAC/BE(This free firmware is literally better), I think sharing some free and trusted firmware is a good move. I’m probably ruining the market for myself and other sellers, but I want to support those who can’t afford expensive solutions.
If you have money, invest in a quality custom firmware. Feel free to contact me shalfiey in discord
If you don’t, feel free to use firmwares that are listed here
